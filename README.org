* Dommy's R code (and some data) to perform tennis-related statistics
** Update 20190723

This stuff is beginning to be more structured and useful. Upon pulling
from this repo you will get the latest tournaments, matches and
players which I pushed to github. However You can just run a local
update by simply issuing: 

: $ Rscript AutoUpdate.R

This command will scrape all the new data from the ATP website since
my last update.

** Update 20190508

- This is an early stage work-in-progress; expect things to change A
  LOT in the near future, as I learn data.table and I understand which
  functionalities really matter.
- As of today we have just a bunch of R functions with no
  documentation whatsoever (RFun_*), some sparsely commented
  example search and webscraping from the ATP website (test_*.R) and a 
  compilation of ATP matches 1968-2019 (due credits to Topspin1985 AKA 
  TennisMyLife and to Jeff Sackmann; license to be resolved).
- The functions should interact nicely with the data from Jeff
  Sackmann ([[https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp]])
- R dependencies: httr, data.table, stringi, stringr, rvest,
  gridExtra, parallel, doParallel, foreach
